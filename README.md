# Project Feedreader testing - FEND

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I was left with an application with an incomplete test suite what I had to finish.

## What did I learn?

I learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.
